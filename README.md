## Introduction

The Flight Booking System API allows users to perform various operations related to flight booking, such as registering as a user, logging in, booking flights, managing bookings, and more. The API is designed to provide a seamless experience for users and administrators.

## Error Handling

The API handles errors using the "createError" utility function. Each endpoint checks for specific conditions and throws an error with an appropriate status code and message. The errors are then handled by the error handling middleware.

##  Authentication and Authorization

The API uses "JSON Web Tokens (JWT)" for user authentication and authorization. When a user or admin logs in, an access token is generated and returned in the response. This token needs to be included in the Authorization header of subsequent requests to authenticate and authorize the user or admin.

All routes except for the authentication routes (/signup and /login) require a valid access token to be included in the request headers. If an invalid or expired token is provided, the API will return a 401 Unauthorized error.
